# Frontend

This is a SPA built using React.
If you are interested in building your own application get started using:
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app.

## Installation

First run `yarn install` in the cd client.
Make sure you .env is all set up with: REACT_APP_GOOGLE_KEY. (this can be found in your https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). 

If you have not yet made a project on console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials, do so and make a new api key to connect to. This will allow google maps to track usage of their api. You will be given a free usage per month but you must keep this api safe as you can be charged for overusage in the scenario that people steal your api key. This is why it is crucial to save your api keys in a .env file.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install, then yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777) to view it in the browser.

In the near future I am considering deploying this application on my own domain and launching this social media platform. This project has not seen the daylight of kick starter yet but one day it will and if you would like to be a supporting contributor of this project please email me (the developer) at benjaminrobertrussell@gmail.com and I will notify you when fundraising has begun.
